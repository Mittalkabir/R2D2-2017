 * \brief     	Obtain pressed keys from a keypad.
 *
 * This is a class that can be used to obtain pressed keys from a keypad using an Arduino Due board.\n
 * The seperate keypresses can be obtained or an array of characters can be filled with pressed characters.\n
 * It uses another namespace containing classes that make it capable of using Arduino Due pins.\n
